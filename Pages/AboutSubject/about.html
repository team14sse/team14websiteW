								<h3>What is Software System Engineering?</h3>
                <h4>A definition from Anthony Finkelstein (Professor of software systems engineering at UCL): </h4>

								<blockquote>Software Systems Engineering is the branch of systems engineering concerned with the development of large and complex software intensive systems. It focusses on: the real-world goals for, services provided by, and constraints on such systems; the precise specification of system structure and behaviour, and the implementation of these specifications; the activities required in order to develop an assurance that the specifications and real-world goals have been met; the evolution of such systems over time and across system families. It is also concerned with the processes, methods and tools for the development of software intensive systems in an economic and timely manner.<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup></blockquote>

								<hr />

								<h4>An overview of its goals</h4>

								<p>Software Systems Engineering is all about creating software that will be used by huge amounts of users on a regular basis, often spread over large geographic areas. However, the research group is not all about writing code, it also deals with how feasible a new system is, how long it will take to create it, how much the project will cost, what problems the project can solve and what it can’t solve etc.</p>

								<p> The research group aims to create free (open source) infrastructures that can be used in industry to solve a variety of problems.</p>

                                <hr />

								<h4>Why it matters?</h4>

								<p>When dealing with huge interconnected systems, it would be incredibly inefficient to rewrite the entire software from scratch every time a change was needed. Therefore, most systems are built upon, instead of rebuilt, this leads to the problem of integrating older versions of software with the new which is where Software Systems Engineering comes into play.</p>

								<p>In recent years focus has shifted from bespoke (custom written) software to more generalised off the shelf software that is locally managed and can then interact with existing complex systems in a variety of industries.</p>

                                <hr />

								<h4>The Future</h4>

								<p>Due to the increasing connectivity of our society, our reliance on software to manage various parts of everyday life has never been higher and this will only increase as technology and automation develops. </p>

								<p>Therefore, to talk about the future of software systems is to talk about the future of society, the demand for new systems integrating with older legacy systems is vast and whole new infrastructures are being created.</p>

								<p>For example, software systems engineering will be paramount in the newly emerging industry of self-driving cars, a potentially world changing technology. Research will need to be done into safety, cost and the ethical issues with a technology spanning multi-cultural countries, all which fall under the work software systems engineers do.</p>
