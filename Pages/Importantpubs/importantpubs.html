							<h2>Important Publications in the field of SSE</h2>
							<p>Outlined below are deemed by us, the most important publications in the field of Software Systems Engineering.</p>
                            <p style="font-size: 0.65em;">While we aknowledge the fact that there are hundreds or even thousands of publications in the field of Software Systems Engineering we can't review every single one of them. Therefore, we curated some which we believe are the most important ones and can potentially have the biggest impact on real-life, making our lives easier,safer or simply more interesting. All publication descriptions are adapted from the publication abstract.</p>

									<h3 style="text-align: center;">The social world of Twitter: Topics, geography, and emotions</h3>
                                    <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em;">Publication by: Quercia, D., Capra, L., Crowcroft, J. (2012) </h4>
								<p>This publication examines whether established sociological theories of real-life networks i.e one of real friends holds true for the Twitter “world”. Specifically the publication examines over 200,000 Twitter profiles and computer some metrics which in sociology define whether a person is part of another persons’ social world (i.e to topics, geography and even emotions). They computed these metrics and tested whether these real-life associations still hold in Twitter. Such a research might prove to be valuable as it could help developers understand how a social network relates to a real-life network, hence being able to write better algorithms that make better predictions or even influence people towards the better.</p>

									<h3 style="text-align: center;">Avoiding the crowds: Understanding Tube station congestion patterns<br>from trip data</h3>
                                    <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em;">Publication by: Ceapa, I., Smith, C., Capra, L. (2012)  </h4>
								<p>This publication suggests that Advanced Traveller Information Systems (ATIS) don’t take into account crowdedness and suggest router based either on number of interchanges or overall travel time. Regardless of how comfortable (in terms of crowdedness) the trip might be. By doing a spatio-temporal analysis the researchers prove that crowdedness is a highly regular phenomenon during the work week, and large spikes occur in short time intervals. They then illustrate how crowding levels can be predicted even using relatively simple techniques using historic averages. Hence the predicted crowding levels could be incorporated into ATIS and therefore provide travellers with more personalised travel plans. Finally such analysis of crowds could help people travel safer and at time which crowding is at minimal in their area. Another important aspect of such a research might be that terrorist attacks could be potentially be predicted using the analysis mentioned before and as crowding is a major factor determining such attacks the publications is of great importance.</p>

								<h3 style="text-align: center;">Information Diffusion and Economic Development</h3>
                                <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em;">Publication by: Smith-clarke, C., Capra</h4>
								<p>In developing countries remains a limited view of the socioeconomic status of the populations partly due to the high cost associated with detailed and comprehensive surveying. Such situation has encouraged number of researchers to attempt to exploit alternative sources of data so as to come up with conclusions. Such alternative data is also mobile phone data, it offers a rich insight into the social dynamics of a population. Looking at the individuals in the city, access to information has been defined as an important factor in determining prosperity and economic development. In the publication, the above relationship is explored by simulating the flow of information through a mobile phone call graph in two sub-Saharan countries. A strong relationship is found between the location’s average wealth and its access to information. Such a finding supports the recent evidence that mining patterns from mobile phone data represents a viable means to estimate poverty in places where official figures are not available or are distorted. </p>

								<h3 style="text-align: center;">Who Benefits from the “Sharing” Economy of Airbnb?</h3>
                                <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em;">Publication by: Quattrone, G., Proserpio, D., Quercia, D., Capra, L., Musolesi, M. (2016)</h4>
								<p>Sharing economy platforms such as Airbnb have soared in popularity the last few years and have changed the way we do numerous things such as commute, travel or even borrow. However, despite their popularity such companies are rather poorly regulated. Airbnb, one of the most successful examples of sharing economy platform is often criticized by regulators and policy makers. In theory municipalities should regulate the emergence of Airbnb through evidence-based policy making, in practice they either impose no regulation or others ban the service all together. The reason behind this is that there is no evidence upon to make policies. In this publication the researchers suggest gathering evidence from the Web and using them for evidence based policy making. By crawling the Airbnb site data for the entire city of London, the researchers found out where and when Airbnb listings are offered and by matching those listings with census and hotel data they determined the socio-economic conditions of the areas that actually benefit from the platform. Such a publication might be very valuable to policy makers as it greatly benefits the country as a whole as it makes it more efficient due to more efficient regulation.</p>

									<h3 style="text-align: center;">Mind the map: The impact of culture and economic affluence on crowd-mapping behaviours</h3>
                                    <h4 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 0.75em;">Publication by: Quattrone, G., Mashhadi, A., Capra, L. (2014)</h4>
								<p>Crowd-mapping is a form of collaborative work that empowers citizens to collect and share geographic knowledge. Applications such as Waze allow the users to GPS so as to map the area the user is into while the user travels and then putting it on a global database to make a complete map. The application used in the publication is Open-StreetMap  (OSM) which is a successful example of crowd-mapping where the goal is to build and maintain an accurate global map which is being accomplished by means of local contributions made by over 1.2M users. The relationship between national culture and economic affluence (i.e wealth) and users’ participation has been unexplored. The publication attempts to categorise the OSM users in terms of who they are, how they contribute, during what period of time and across what geographic areas. The researchers find strong correlations between the above characteristics and national culture factors such as individualism, pace of life and self-expression as well as Gross Domestic Product per capita. Based on the above finding, the publication discusses design issues that developers of such crowd-mapping services should consider to account, for differences between cultures.</p>
